**Atomic (VER: INSTABLE-TE-2024-0.1)**
=====================================

**Introduction**
---------------

Atomic is a programming language created by Fly Labs, led by CEO Stutya Patwal. This release, version INSTABLE-TE-2024-0.1, is for fun purposes only and should not be used for large-scale projects yet.

**Unique Features**
-------------------

* **Translator-based**: Atomic doesn't use a compiler or interpreter. Instead, it uses a translator that converts `.at` (Atomic) code to `.py` (Python) code.
* **Python Integration**: Due to the translator, Atomic code can seamlessly integrate with Python code and modules.
* **No OOP Support**: Atomic does not support object-oriented programming (OOP) and likely will not in the future.

**Current State**
-----------------

This release includes the following features:

* **Display, Variable, and Comment**: Basic syntax elements are implemented.
* **File Management**: File verification and opening are functional.
* **Runner**: The compiler and file management systems are integrated.
* **Python Code Execution**: The compiler can execute Python code.
* **Text Input**: A text input function is available.
* **Valnum**: A value-number system is implemented.
* **Print Function**: The `out` keyword is used for printing.
* **Control Structures**: If-else statements, logical operators, and while loops are supported.
* **MAYBE Keyword**: A probabilistic programming construct is introduced.

**Development Notes**
--------------------

* 31 May 2024: Initial setup of compiler backend, display, variable, and comment.
* 1 June 2024: Runner testing, Python code execution, and text input function added.
* 5 June 2024: Valnum implementation and print function introduced.
* 6 June 2024: If-else statements, logical operators, and while loops added.

**Future Directions**
--------------------

Some potential features to explore in future releases:

* **Probabilistic Programming**: Build upon the MAYBE keyword to introduce more probabilistic constructs.
* **Context-Aware Programming**: Introduce a CONTEXT keyword for context-dependent behavior.
* **Emotional Intelligence**: Incorporate emotional intelligence into the language.
* **NLP Integration**: Allow seamless integration with NLP models and libraries.
* **Visual Programming**: Introduce a visual programming paradigm.
* **Time-Travel Debugging**: Implement a TIME_TRAVEL keyword for debugging.
* **Collaborative Programming**: Introduce features for real-time collaborative coding.
* **Gamification**: Incorporate game-like elements into the language.
* **AI-Assisted Coding**: Introduce an AI_ASSIST keyword for AI-generated code suggestions.
* **Environmental Awareness**: Incorporate features that promote sustainable coding practices.
