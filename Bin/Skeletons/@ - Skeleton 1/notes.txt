- the compiler converts @ code to python code
- #1 checks if the file given is @
  #2 clears all comments from the file
  #3 normalizes the program or sets the program according to the SOE
  #4 sends the program to compile function to get it converted to python code
  #5 the program writes it to program.py file 
- the piece of code without a SOE is executed after the piece of code with a SOE
- a line of code must have an keyword
- if two peice of code have the same SOE then the one which appears first would executed first


- problem in normalize function
